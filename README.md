# LaTex Notes Template

My template for LaTex notes. I use it for taking notes on books and lectures.
View a sample at [sample.pdf](sample.pdf).

## Usage

Download the repository as a zip file and extract it. You can then open the `main.tex` file in your LaTex editor of choice. If you are using Overleaf, you can just copy this one file into a new project.
